In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Tauri's state management system to share data across different parts of your Rust-based Tauri application.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Rust programming.
- Basic understanding of Tauri application structure.
- Rust and Tauri installed on your machine.

## Step 1: Define Your Application State

First, define a struct to represent the shared state of your application.

```rust
struct AppState {
    // Add fields that you want to share across your app
    count: Mutex<i32>,
}
```

## Step 2: Initialize and Manage State in Tauri

In your main application setup, initialize the state and pass it to the Tauri application using the `manage` method.

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .setup(|app| {
            let app_state = AppState {
                count: Mutex::new(0),
            };
            app.manage(app_state);
            Ok(())
        })
        // Rest of the Tauri setup...
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

## Step 3: Access and Modify State in Command Handlers

Use the `State` extractor in your Tauri command handlers to interact with the state.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn increment_counter(state: tauri::State<AppState>) {
    let mut count = state.count.lock().unwrap();
    *count += 1;
}
```

## Step 4: Use State in Your Tauri Frontend

In your frontend code (like a web page), you can call the Tauri command to interact with the state.

```javascript
// Example using JavaScript
async function increaseCount() {
    await window.__TAURI__.invoke('increment_counter');
}
```

## Conclusion

You now know how to effectively use Tauri's state management system. This allows you to share and modify data across different parts of your Tauri application in a thread-safe manner.
